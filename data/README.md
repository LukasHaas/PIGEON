# Data

This directory only shows the high-level folder structure we used. The Media Placing Eval 2016 dataset (```mp_16```), Google Landmarks V2 dataset (```google_landmarks```), our proprietary Street View dataset (```streetview_cropped```), and all benchmarks (```gws15k```, ```im2gps```, ```im2gps3k```, ```yfcc4k```, ```yfcc26k```) are all not included as part of this code release.

All datasets except our proprietary Street View dataset and the ```gws15k``` benchmark dataset can be publicly obtained online.
